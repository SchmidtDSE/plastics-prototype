Plastics Prototype
===============================================================================
Prototype for the plastics decision support tool with transparent intervention code / authoring.

<br>

## Variables
Built-in variables for the interventions scripts take the following form:

- **in.**: Variables like `in.chinaMinimumRecyclingRate` refer to the levers that a user can manipulate in the sliders.
- **out.**: Variables like `out.china.consumptionPackagingMT` refer to the outputs from the model. These should be modified by the interventions to change the visualizations.

The regions for `out.region` are as follows:

 - global
 - china
 - eu30
 - nafta
 - row

The sectorial consumption amounts are as follows (like `out.china.consumptionPackagingMT`):

 - consumptionPackagingMT
 - consumptionConstructionMT
 - consumptionTextileMT
 - consumptionHouseholdLeisureSportsMT
 - consumptionElectronicMT
 - consumptionTransporationMT
 - consumptionAgricultureMT
 - consumptionOtherMT

The end of life attributes are as follows (like `out.eu30.eolLandfillMT`):

 - eolLandfillMT
 - eolIncinerationMT
 - eolMismanagedMT
 - eolRecyclingMT

Finally, production are as follows (like `out.nafta.netImportsMT`):

 - netImportsMT
 - netExportsMT
 - domesticProductionMT
